# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This study guide was created to help myself and others get familiarized with the basics of creating a web page. With HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript, creating a web page is a lot of information to remember so building this study guide can aid others with the basic knowledge so they won't get overwhelmed. This study guide teaches how to create structure with HTML as well as its different elements, how to add style with CSS as well as its different elements, how to make everything interactive with JavaScript as well as its different functions, and how to use Git to connect these documents to the command line interface (CLI). This project taught me and hopefully this prework study guide can help others show how HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript all work together to create a project.
